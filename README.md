# Disaster Response Pipeline Project
This project is to classify disaster response messages through machine learning. 

- process_data.py reads in the data, cleans and stores it in a SQL database. 
- train_classifier.py includes the code necessary to load data, transform it using natural language processing, run a machine learning model and train it. 
- the app folder includes all the files needed to run the Flask app and the user interface along with some visualizations.
